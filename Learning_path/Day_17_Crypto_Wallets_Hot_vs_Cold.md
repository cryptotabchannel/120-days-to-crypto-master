# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 17
## 📍 How Do Crypto Wallets Work? Hot vs. Cold Storage 🔐

Your crypto is only as safe as your wallet. Let’s explore the two main types and how to protect your assets:

### 🔹 Hot Wallets (Online):
✅ Connected to the internet  
✅ Great for trading & quick access  
🔸 **Examples:** MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet  
⚠️ **Risk:** More vulnerable to hacks & phishing

### 🔹 Cold Wallets (Offline):
✅ Not connected to the internet  
✅ Ideal for long-term holding (HODLing)  
🔸 **Examples:** Ledger, Trezor (hardware wallets)  
⚠️ **Risk:** Physical loss or damage (but safer from cyber attacks)

---

### 🧠 Which One Should You Use?
• **Traders** ➜ Hot wallet for quick moves  
• **Investors** ➜ Cold wallet for secure long-term storage  
• **Best** ➜ Use both (hot wallet for activity, cold for safety)

### 🔐 Security Tips:
✅ Always back up your seed phrase  
✅ Use strong passwords & 2FA  
✅ Don’t store large funds on exchanges
