# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 15
## 📍 What Is a Crypto Wallet? Hot vs Cold Wallets 🔐

You’ve probably heard the phrase: “Not your keys, not your coins.”
That’s why today we’re diving into wallets — where you really own your crypto.

### 🔹 Hot Wallets (Connected to the internet)
**Examples**: MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Phantom

- ✅ Easy access
- ✅ Good for frequent use and DeFi
- ⚠️ Vulnerable to hacks, phishing, and malware

### 🔹 Cold Wallets (Offline wallets)
**Examples**: Ledger, Trezor

- ✅ Ultimate security — not connected to the internet
- ✅ Great for holding large amounts
- ⚠️ Less convenient for frequent trading

### 🔐 Wallet = Private Key Access
- ✔️ Your private key is the password to your crypto.
- ✔️ If someone else has it, they own your funds.

### 🧠 Pro Tip:
Store long-term holdings in a cold wallet, and only keep what you need for daily use in a hot wallet.

### 🧪 Today’s Task:
- ✅ Download a hot wallet (if you haven’t already).
- ✅ Learn how to back up your seed phrase safely — write it on paper, never online!
- ✅ Research cold wallets if you're serious about security.
