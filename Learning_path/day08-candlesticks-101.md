# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 8
## 📊 How to Read a Crypto Chart – Candlesticks 101

If you're interested in trading or investing in crypto, learning to read **candlestick charts** is essential — they visually show price movement over time.

---

## 🔹 What Is a Candlestick?

Each candlestick represents price action within a specific time frame (e.g., 1 minute, 15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day).

### Parts of a Candlestick:
- **Body**: Shows the **open** and **close** prices
- **Wick (Shadow)**: Shows the **high** and **low** prices

### Candlestick Colors:
- 🟩 **Green (or white)** = Price increased (close > open)
- 🟥 **Red (or black)** = Price decreased (close < open)

## 🔹 Why Candlesticks Matter

Understanding candlesticks helps you decode market sentiment and trends:

- 💎 **Long upper wick** = Selling pressure
- 💎 **Long lower wick** = Buying pressure
- 💎 **Small body** = Indecision (potential reversal)

---

## 💡 Key Candlestick Patterns

Begin with these common patterns:
- ✅ **Bullish Engulfing** – potential reversal upward
- ✅ **Doji** – market indecision
- ✅ **Hammer** – bullish reversal
- ✅ **Shooting Star** – bearish reversal

Identifying these patterns helps in predicting price moves and planning entries/exits.
