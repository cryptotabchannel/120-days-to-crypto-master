# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 7
## ⚔️ Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake – What’s the Difference?

In blockchain technology, consensus mechanisms are how networks agree on the validity of transactions. The two most popular mechanisms are:

---

## 🔹 Proof of Work (PoW)
- ✅ Used by **Bitcoin**, **Litecoin**
- 🧠 Miners solve complex mathematical problems
- 🔐 Highly secure
- ⚡️ High energy consumption
- 🐢 Slower and more expensive transactions

---

## 🔹 Proof of Stake (PoS)
- ✅ Used by **Ethereum** (after the Merge), **Solana**, **Cardano**
- 🧠 Validators are selected based on how much crypto they "stake"
- ⚡️ Faster and more energy-efficient
- 💰 Enables staking rewards
- 🔐 Still secure but newer than PoW

---

## 💡 Why It Matters

Understanding PoW vs PoS helps you:
- ✔️ Pick better blockchain projects
- ✔️ Understand network fees and speeds
- ✔️ Participate in staking and earn passive income

Examples:
- **Bitcoin = PoW**: Secure but slow
- **Ethereum = PoS**: Efficient and evolving
- **Staking on PoS** chains earns you rewards

---

## 🧠 Task of the Day

🔍 Look up your favorite cryptocurrency and check if it uses PoW or PoS.  
💡 Bonus: Research a smaller PoS project and explore how staking works on that chain.
