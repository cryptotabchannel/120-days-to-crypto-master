## 📍 Support and Resistance: The Foundation of Technical Analysis

Support and resistance are two of the most important concepts in trading. Almost every strategy, indicator, and price action setup depends on them!

### 🔹 What Is Support?
Support is a price level where buying interest is strong enough to overcome selling pressure.  
➡️ When price falls to support, it often bounces back up.

### 🔹 What Is Resistance?
Resistance is a price level where selling pressure overcomes buying.  
➡️ When price rises to resistance, it often pulls back down.

### 🔹 Key Points:
✅ Old resistance can become new support after a breakout  
✅ The more times a level is tested, the stronger it becomes  
✅ Strong support/resistance zones are often near previous highs/lows or round numbers

### 🧠 Pro Tip:
Don't just draw lines randomly. Look for clusters of wicks and closes at similar price points. That's where real support or resistance exists.
