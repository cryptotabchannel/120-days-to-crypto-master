# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 14
## 📍 What Is an Exchange? CEX vs DEX Explained!

Before you can trade crypto, you need to understand where trading happens — on exchanges. There are two main types: Centralized (CEX) and Decentralized (DEX).

### 🔹 Centralized Exchanges (CEX)
**Examples:** Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin

- ✅ Easy to use
- ✅ High liquidity
- ✅ Fiat support (you can use USD, EUR, etc.)
- ⚠️ You must trust the company — they control your funds until you withdraw.

### 🔹 Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)
**Examples:** Uniswap, PancakeSwap, dYdX

- ✅ You own your keys — you control your assets
- ✅ No registration needed (just connect a wallet)
- ✅ Often lower fees
- ⚠️ Sometimes lower liquidity, especially for rare coins.

### 🔹 Which One Should You Use?
- ✔️ Beginners often start on a CEX for simplicity.
- ✔️ Once you understand wallets and security, DEXs give you full control and freedom.

### 🧠 Pro Tip:
Never leave large amounts on an exchange!
➡️ Always withdraw to your own wallet (like MetaMask, Ledger, or Trust Wallet) for safety.

### 🧪 Today’s Task:
- ✅ Register an account on a CEX if you don't have one.
- ✅ Also explore a DEX and practice swapping a small amount (even $5 is enough to learn)!
