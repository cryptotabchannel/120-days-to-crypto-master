# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 22
## 📍 Crypto Wallets Explained – Hot vs Cold Storage 🔐

Before you can securely hold your crypto, you need to understand wallets — and no, we're not talking about leather ones!

### 🔹 What is a Crypto Wallet?
A wallet stores your private keys, giving you access to your cryptocurrency. It doesn’t store the crypto itself, but allows you to interact with the blockchain.

### 🔥 Hot Wallets (Online)
✔️ Examples: MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet  
✔️ Connected to the internet  
✔️ Great for quick access and trading  
⚠️ Riskier due to potential online threats (hacks, phishing)

### 🧊 Cold Wallets (Offline)
✔️ Examples: Ledger, Trezor (hardware), paper wallets  
✔️ Completely offline  
✔️ Best for long-term storage and safety  
⚠️ Can be lost if not backed up properly

### 🧠 Security Tips:
- Use 2FA on hot wallets
- Never share your seed phrase
- Keep backups of your private keys
- Consider cold wallets for large amounts

### 🧪 Today’s Task:
✅ Download and set up a hot wallet (e.g. Trust Wallet or MetaMask)  
✅ Explore how to send/receive tokens
