## 📍 What Are Gas Fees? And How to Avoid Overpaying⛽️

If you’ve ever tried to send crypto or mint an NFT, you’ve probably seen gas fees. But what are they, and how can you pay less?

### 🔹 What Are Gas Fees?
Gas fees are payments users make to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate transactions on a blockchain — mostly on Ethereum.

🛠 **Example**: Sending ETH or swapping tokens on Uniswap requires gas.

### 🔸 Why Do Gas Fees Fluctuate?
Gas prices are based on network demand.
- 🔼 More transactions = higher fees
- 🔽 Less activity = lower fees

### 💡 How to Pay Less Gas Fees:
- ✔️ Use the network during off-peak hours
- ✔️ Try Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism)
- ✔️ Use gas fee tracking tools like Etherscan’s gas tracker
- ✔️ Set a custom gas limit in wallets like MetaMask
- ✔️ Choose low-fee blockchains (like Solana, Avalanche)

### 🧪 Today’s Task:
- ✅ Visit [etherscan.io/gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) and monitor fee changes
- ✅ Compare gas fees on Ethereum vs Layer 2 networks
- ✅ Try a small transaction on a low-fee chain (like Polygon)
