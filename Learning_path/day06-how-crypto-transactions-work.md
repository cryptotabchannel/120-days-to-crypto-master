# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 6
## 🔁 How Do Crypto Transactions Work?

Every time you send or receive cryptocurrency, you are interacting directly with the **blockchain** by broadcasting a transaction.

Let’s break the process down:

---

## 🔹 Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Wallet Interaction**
   - You initiate a transaction using your crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet).

2. **Digital Signature**
   - The transaction is signed using your **private key**, proving you are the rightful owner.

3. **Broadcast to the Network**
   - The signed transaction is sent to the blockchain network and enters the **mempool** (a waiting list of pending transactions).

4. **Mining or Validation**
   - **Miners** (in Proof of Work) or **Validators** (in Proof of Stake) pick it up and confirm the transaction by adding it to a new block.

5. **Confirmations Begin**
   - As blocks are added, your transaction receives **confirmations** — increasing its security.
