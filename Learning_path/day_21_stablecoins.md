# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 21
## 📍 What Are Stablecoins? 🔐

Stablecoins are the bridge between traditional finance and crypto — they bring stability to a volatile market.

---

### 🔹 Definition:
A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US Dollar (USD), Euro, or even gold.

---

### 💵 Popular Stablecoins:
- ✅ **USDT (Tether)** – Most widely used
- ✅ **USDC (Circle)** – Audited and transparent
- ✅ **DAI** – Decentralized and backed by crypto assets
- ✅ **BUSD** – Binance-backed, recently phased out by some exchanges

---

### 🧭 Use Cases:
- Hedge against crypto volatility
- Store value without converting to fiat
- Easier cross-border transactions
- Powering DeFi protocols (lending, farming, etc.)

---

### ⚠️ Risks to Watch For:
- Centralized control (for USDT, USDC)
- Regulatory issues
- Peg-breaking events (like UST crash)

---

### 🧪 Today’s Task:
- ✅ Compare USDT vs USDC at [CoinGecko](https://coingecko.com)
- ✅ Research how DAI maintains its peg
- ✅ Try sending a stablecoin to a friend (test with a small amount!)
