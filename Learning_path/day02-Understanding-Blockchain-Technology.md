# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 2  
## 🔑 Understanding Blockchain Technology

🧱 At the core of every cryptocurrency is the **blockchain** — a digital ledger that securely records transactions across a decentralized network.

### 🔍 What is a Blockchain?  
Imagine a chain of digital “blocks,” each containing a group of verified transactions. Once added, blocks are **immutable** — meaning they can’t be changed — ensuring **transparency**, **trust**, and **security**.

### 💡 Key Features:  
- 🚫 No central authority  
- ✅ Fully transparent and publicly viewable  
- 🔐 Secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof

### ⛏️ New blocks are added through:  
- **Mining** (Proof-of-Work, e.g., Bitcoin)  
- **Staking** (Proof-of-Stake, e.g., Ethereum 2.0)
