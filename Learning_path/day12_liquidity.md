# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 12
## 📍 Liquidity: The Secret Fuel of Market Moves

Ever wonder why price suddenly spikes or drops near key zones? The answer is: **Liquidity**.

---

### 🔹 What Is Liquidity?

Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without causing large price swings. In crypto, **liquidity zones** are areas where lots of orders (like stop losses and take profits) are clustered.

---

### 🔹 Why It Matters

Smart traders and institutions hunt for liquidity to:

- ✅ Fill large orders
- ✅ Trigger stop hunts
- ✅ Manipulate weak hands for better entry

---

### 🔹 Where Is Liquidity Usually Found?

- Around **swing highs and lows**
- Just **above resistance** or **below support**
- Near **psychological price levels** (e.g., $30,000, $100, etc.)

---

### 🧠 Pro Tip

> Instead of blindly buying at resistance or selling at support, ask:
> **“Where would most traders place their stop-loss?”**
>
> That’s where liquidity hides — and where price often hunts.

---

### 🧪 Today’s Task

1. Open the chart of any volatile coin (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL).
2. Mark the nearest **liquidity pool** above and below current price.
3. Watch how price behaves around those zones — does it reject or break through?
