# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 5
## 🔐 What Makes Crypto Secure? — Introduction to Cryptography

The **"crypto"** in **cryptocurrency** comes from **cryptography** — the science of securing data and communication. It’s the backbone of how your digital assets stay safe on decentralized networks.

## 🔒 2 Key Concepts in Crypto Security

### 🔑 Public Key Cryptography
- Every crypto wallet has:
  - A **public key** (your wallet address)
  - A **private key** (your secret password)
- Anyone can send crypto to your public key.
- Only **you** can spend it using the private key.

### 🧩 Hash Functions
- Each block on the blockchain has a **unique hash** (a digital fingerprint).
- Hashes ensure **data integrity** and prevent **tampering** with historical transactions.

> 💡 If you lose your **private key** or **seed phrase**, you permanently lose access to your crypto.
