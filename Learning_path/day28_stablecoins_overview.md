## 📍 Understanding Stablecoins: USDT, USDC, DAI, and More 💵

Stablecoins are the backbone of crypto trading and DeFi. Let’s explore how they work and why they matter.

### 💡 What Are Stablecoins?
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US Dollar (USD).

### 🔸 Examples:
- ⚡️ **USDT (Tether)** – Centralized, backed by reserves
- ⚡️ **USDC (Circle/Coinbase)** – Fully regulated and transparent
- ⚡️ **DAI (MakerDAO)** – Decentralized, backed by crypto collateral
- ⚡️ **BUSD** – Previously issued by Binance (no longer minted)

### 🏦 Types of Stablecoins:
- ⚡️ **Fiat-Collateralized:** Backed by USD in bank accounts (USDC, USDT)
- ⚡️ **Crypto-Collateralized:** Backed by other crypto assets (DAI)
- ⚡️ **Algorithmic:** Maintain value using smart contracts and supply-demand rules (e.g., UST — failed)

### 🧠 Why Use Stablecoins?
- ✅ Protection from crypto volatility
- ✅ Easy transfers without converting to fiat
- ✅ Earn yield in DeFi platforms
- ✅ Used in lending, borrowing, and staking

### ⚠️ Risks to Watch:
- ❗️ Centralized control (USDT, USDC can be frozen)
- ❗️ Depegging risks (UST crash example)
- ❗️ Regulatory pressure from governments

### 🧪 Today’s Task:
- ✅ Research and compare USDT vs. USDC vs. DAI
- ✅ Use MetaMask or another wallet to store at least one stablecoin
- ✅ Try swapping ETH → USDT on Uniswap or a similar DEX
