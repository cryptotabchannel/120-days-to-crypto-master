## 📍 Understanding Stablecoins – The Backbone of Crypto Liquidity 💵

Stablecoins are essential in crypto. They reduce volatility, simplify trading, and enable DeFi operations. Let’s break it down 👇

### 💡 What Are Stablecoins?
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset, usually fiat currencies like the US Dollar.

➡️ Their goal? Maintain a 1:1 value with that asset (e.g., 1 USDT ≈ $1 USD)

### 🔹 Types of Stablecoins:

**Fiat-Backed**
✅ Backed by real dollars in a bank  
🔸 Examples: USDT (Tether), USDC (Circle)

**Crypto-Backed**
✅ Collateralized by other cryptocurrencies  
🔸 Example: DAI (MakerDAO)

**Algorithmic**
✅ Use smart contracts to manage supply  
🔸 Example: FRAX (partially algorithmic)

### 🔸 Why Are Stablecoins Important?
✔️ Reduce risk during high volatility  
✔️ Used for trading pairs on exchanges  
✔️ Enable lending/borrowing in DeFi  
✔️ Help transfer value globally with low fees
