# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 25
## 📍 Introduction to DeFi (Decentralized Finance) 🔓

DeFi is one of the biggest revolutions in the crypto world. It's reshaping traditional finance by removing intermediaries like banks.

### 💡 What is DeFi?
DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance, a system that allows you to access financial services (like borrowing, lending, trading, and earning interest) without banks or brokers — using blockchain tech instead.

### 🔹 Core Features of DeFi:
✅ Permissionless – anyone can access  
✅ Transparent – code is visible  
✅ Open – anyone can build on it  
✅ Non-custodial – you control your assets  

### 🔸 Popular DeFi Platforms:
- **Aave** – Borrow/lend crypto  
- **Uniswap** – Swap tokens  
- **Compound** – Earn interest  
- **Curve** – Stablecoin trading  
- **MakerDAO** – Decentralized stablecoin ($DAI)  

### 📊 Why DeFi Matters:
✔️ Global financial access  
✔️ Higher yields compared to banks  
✔️ Open innovation in finance
