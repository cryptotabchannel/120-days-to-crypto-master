## 🔁 What is Blockchain?

**Blockchain** is the foundational technology behind most cryptocurrencies.  
Think of it as a **decentralized digital ledger** that records every transaction **publicly** and **permanently**.

## 💡 Key Features of Blockchain

- 🔹 **Decentralized** – No single person or company controls it  
- 🔹 **Immutable** – Once data is recorded, it cannot be changed  
- 🔹 **Transparent** – Anyone can verify the transaction history  
- 🔹 **Secure** – Cryptography protects the integrity of data

📦 Imagine a spreadsheet duplicated across **thousands of computers**, always updated and verified — that's blockchain.
