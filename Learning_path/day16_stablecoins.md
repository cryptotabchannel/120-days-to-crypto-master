# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 16  
## 📍 What Are Stablecoins? Why They're Important in Crypto 🔄💵

In crypto, price volatility is everywhere. That’s where stablecoins come in — tokens designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar.

### 🔹 Top Stablecoins:
- **USDT (Tether)** – most used, backed by reserves  
- **USDC (Circle)** – audited, U.S.-based  
- **DAI** – decentralized, backed by crypto collateral  
- **BUSD** – Binance USD (recently under pressure)

---

### 🔒 Why Use Stablecoins?
✅ Escape market volatility  
✅ Trade easily without converting to fiat  
✅ Use in DeFi (lending, staking, farming)  
✅ Fast transfers with low fees

---

### ⚠️ Risks to Watch Out For:
- Centralized control (USDT, USDC)  
- Regulatory pressure  
- Algorithmic failures (like the Terra/UST collapse)

---

### 🧠 Pro Tip:
> Never put all your savings in a single stablecoin.  
> Diversify across trusted ones and understand how they’re backed.

---

### 🧪 Today’s Task:
- ✅ Pick one stablecoin to research in depth  
- ✅ Track its market cap and see where it’s used (DeFi, exchanges, etc.)  
- ✅ Try a small swap between a crypto and a stablecoin on a DEX (if you're ready)
