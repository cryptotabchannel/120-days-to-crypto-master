# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 11  
## 📍 Understanding Market Structure – The Blueprint of Price Movement

If price charts look chaotic, it's time to learn **Market Structure** — the logic behind every price swing.

---

## 🔹 What Is Market Structure?

Market structure tracks the pattern of **highs and lows** in the market to identify its current state:

- ✅ **Bullish:** Higher Highs (HH) + Higher Lows (HL)
- ✅ **Bearish:** Lower Highs (LH) + Lower Lows (LL)
- ✅ **Ranging:** Sideways movement with no clear trend

---

## 🔹 Why Market Structure Matters

Understanding structure helps you:

- 🔍 Trade with the trend  
- ❌ Avoid false entries  
- 🔄 Predict potential reversals

---

## 🔹 3 Key Phases to Recognize

1. **Impulse** – Strong directional moves  
2. **Correction** – Brief pullbacks  
3. **Consolidation** – Sideways action before the next move

---

> ### 🧠 Pro Tip:
> Never trade against the market structure.  
> If the market is forming **lower highs**, wait for the trend to shift before entering.  
> **Patience = Profit.**
