# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 24
## 📍 What Are Smart Contracts? 🤖

Smart contracts are the brain behind most of the innovation in crypto. Let’s explore how they work and why they matter.

### 🔹 What is a Smart Contract?
A smart contract is a self-executing program stored on the blockchain that runs when certain conditions are met.

Think of it as:
📝 "If X happens, then do Y" — no human intervention needed!

### 🔸 Where Are Smart Contracts Used?
✅ DeFi (e.g. lending/borrowing on Aave)  
✅ NFTs (minting and transferring)  
✅ DAOs (automated governance)  
✅ Token swaps (like on Uniswap)

### 🔐 Why Are They Powerful?
✔️ Trustless – no middlemen needed  
✔️ Transparent – everyone can verify the code  
✔️ Secure – runs exactly as programmed

### 📌 Example Use Case:
A loan platform like Compound uses smart contracts to automatically handle deposits, loans, and interest — all without a bank!

### 🧪 Today’s Task:
✅ Explore Ethereum smart contracts on [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io)  
✅ Read the basics of Solidity (Ethereum’s smart contract language)  
✅ Try using a DeFi dApp (like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) or [Compound](https://compound.finance)) and observe how it interacts with your wallet
