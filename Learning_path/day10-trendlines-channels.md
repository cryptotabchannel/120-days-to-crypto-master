# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 10
## 📍 Trendlines & Channels – Spotting Market Direction

Understanding **trendlines** and **price channels** is key to reading market direction like a pro. These tools help you track trends, spot breakouts, and plan entries/exits with confidence.

---

## 🔹 What Is a Trendline?

A **trendline** is a straight line that connects:

- 🔼 **Higher lows** in an **uptrend**
- 🔽 **Lower highs** in a **downtrend**

It gives a clear visual of market direction and momentum.

---

## 🔹 Types of Trendlines

✅ **Uptrend Line** – Drawn by connecting two or more **rising lows**  
✅ **Downtrend Line** – Drawn by connecting two or more **falling highs**

📏 A valid trendline needs **at least 2 touches** to confirm reliability.

---

## 🔹 What Are Price Channels?

A **price channel** is formed when two **parallel trendlines** contain the price movement:

- 📈 **Ascending channel** – Both lines sloping upward
- 📉 **Descending channel** – Both lines sloping downward
- 🔁 **Horizontal channel** – Sideways price action

Think of channels as **price highways** — the price often stays in these lanes until a **breakout** or **breakdown** occurs.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tip

📌 The **more times** a trendline is respected (tested and holds), the **more reliable** it becomes.  
📉 Breakouts from channels often lead to **strong momentum moves**.

---

## 🧪 Today’s Task

1. Open a chart for an altcoin like **SOL** or **AVAX** on [TradingView](https://tradingview.com).
2. Switch to the **1H or 4H timeframe**.
3. Draw a trendline connecting recent **lows** or **highs**.
4. Check if price is in a **channel** and whether it's rising, falling, or flat.
