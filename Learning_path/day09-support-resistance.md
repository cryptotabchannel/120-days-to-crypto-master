# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 9
## 📍 Support and Resistance – The Backbone of Price Action

If you're serious about mastering crypto trading, you need to understand **support** and **resistance** — these levels are critical in determining **entry** and **exit** points.

---

## 🔹 What Is Support?

A price level where **buyers enter the market**, preventing further decline.

💡 Think of **support** as a **"floor"** — the price tends to bounce off this level.

---

## 🔹 What Is Resistance?

A level where **sellers dominate**, stopping price from climbing further.

💡 Think of **resistance** as a **"ceiling"** — price often gets rejected here.

---

## 🔹 How to Identify Support and Resistance

✅ Look for **areas where the price has bounced multiple times**  
✅ Use **horizontal zones**, not just a single line  
✅ Combine with **candlestick patterns** for stronger confirmation  

---

## 🧠 Pro Tip

🔄 **Support can turn into resistance** (and vice versa) after a **breakout** or **breakdown** — this is known as a role reversal.

These areas are crucial for:
- Entry timing
- Setting stop-loss
- Taking profits

---
