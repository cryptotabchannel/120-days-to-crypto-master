# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 18
## 📍 Intro to Web3: What It Is & Why It Matters 🌐

You've heard the term Web3 everywhere—but what is it, really?

### 🔹 Web Evolution:
- **Web1** ➜ Read-Only Internet
- **Web2** ➜ Read + Write (Social Media, Apps, Platforms)
- **Web3** ➜ Read + Write + Own (Decentralized, Tokenized Internet)

### 💡 Web3 Key Concepts:
- **Decentralization** — No central authority
- **Blockchain** — Stores all activity (open & verifiable)
- **Tokens & Ownership** — You own your data, identity, and assets
- **Smart Contracts** — Programs that run automatically on blockchains

### 🚀 What Makes Web3 Special?
✅ Users control their identity and assets  
✅ No need to trust third parties  
✅ Open participation (anyone can interact)  
✅ Economic incentives (get paid in crypto)  

### 🧪 Today’s Task:
- ✅ Research a popular Web3 project (e.g., Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana)
- ✅ Visit a dApp (like Uniswap, OpenSea, or Aave)
- ✅ Learn how your wallet connects directly to these services
