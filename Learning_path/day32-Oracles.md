## 📍 What Are Oracles in Blockchain? 🛰

Blockchains are closed systems by default — they cannot access real-world data on their own. That’s where oracles come in.

---

## 🔍 What Is a Blockchain Oracle?
A blockchain oracle is a service that brings external (off-chain) data into the blockchain so smart contracts can interact with the real world.

---

## 🌐 Real-World Examples:
- 🔄 Price feeds (ETH/USD, BTC/USDT)  
- 🌦 Weather data for insurance smart contracts  
- ⚽️ Sports scores for decentralized betting platforms  
- 📊 Financial APIs for DeFi protocols  

---

## 🔗 Types of Oracles:
- **Software oracles** – Provide data from the internet (e.g., APIs)  
- **Hardware oracles** – Connect with physical sensors/IoT devices  
- **Inbound vs. Outbound oracles** – Data into vs. out of blockchain  
- **Decentralized oracles** – Multiple sources, more secure  

---

## 💡 Top Oracle Projects to Know:
- **Chainlink (LINK)** – The most adopted oracle network  
- **Band Protocol (BAND)** – Fast and cost-effective alternative  
- **API3** – Allows API providers to directly run their own oracles  

---

## ⚠️ Oracle Problem:
Smart contracts are only as trustworthy as the oracles they use.  
A compromised oracle = compromised contract logic.
