# 📚 Crypto Learning Path – Day 19
## 📍 What Are Smart Contracts? 🤖

Smart contracts are the brains of blockchain apps — they automate transactions and eliminate middlemen.

### 🔹 Definition:
A smart contract is a self-executing program stored on the blockchain. It runs automatically when predefined conditions are met.

### 💡 Why They Matter:
✅ No third-party needed (like banks or lawyers)  
✅ Immutable — once deployed, can’t be changed  
✅ Transparent — anyone can verify the code  
✅ Trustless — "Code is law"

### 🛠 Real-World Use Cases:
• Decentralized exchanges (e.g., Uniswap)  
• Lending platforms (e.g., Aave)  
• NFTs and marketplaces (e.g., OpenSea)  
• Gaming and metaverse economies  
• Insurance, voting, DAOs, and more

### 🧪 Today’s Task:
✅ Go to [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) and explore a smart contract  
✅ Visit a dApp like [Uniswap.org](https://uniswap.org) and connect your wallet  
✅ Read about Solidity — the main language used to write smart contracts
